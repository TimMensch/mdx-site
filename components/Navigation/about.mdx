Hi, I'm **Eric Clemmons**.

I create better user & developer experiences through open-source software,
metrics-driven experiments, and reducing friction.

I specialize in building **remote teams** developing **full-stack applications**
with technologies such as TypeScript, React, & GraphQL that enable metrics-driven **experimentation**.
